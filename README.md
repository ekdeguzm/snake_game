# snake_game

I created this game following a tutorial by TokyoEdTech. The purpose of this exercise was to practice understanding how to use for and while loops to create a a moving snake while adding on segments to the snake to make it longer. I used the turtle, time, and random, modules to create this game. 

I thought that this game was fun to make! My high score is 430, can you beat it?
